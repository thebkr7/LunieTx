##A node server to retrieve and track memo's from transactions on the Cosmos blockchain.


Run: 1. npm install 2. node server.js


Todo:
'/sync' endpoint is mainly commented out due to having to call the function with manual inputs right now.

'/lunieTransactionCount' endpoint is not connected to the db instance but does work locally
